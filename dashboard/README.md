## Technologies Used

- **Streamlit** - Dashboard framework
- **Plotly** - Interactive visualizations
- **Neo4j** - Graph database
- **Pandas** - Data manipulation

## Tips

- Use the sidebar to navigate between different sections
- All searches are case-insensitive
- Click on interactive charts to zoom and explore
- Expand data tables to see full details
- Use browser back button if needed (Streamlit maintains state)

## Troubleshooting

**Dashboard won't start:**

- Ensure streamlit is installed: `pip install streamlit`
- Check you're in the dashboard directory

**No data showing:**

- Verify Neo4j is running: `docker ps | grep neo4j`
- Ensure data is loaded: Check Neo4j browser at http://localhost:7474
- Run loader: `cd ../database && python3 loader.py`

**Connection error:**

- Check Neo4j credentials match environment variables
- Verify Neo4j is accessible at bolt://localhost:7687

## Future Enhancements (Phase 2)

- Shortest path algorithm visualization
- Network graph of airport connections
- Airline route network comparison
- Export data to CSV
- Advanced filtering options
- Real-time search suggestions
